## Working Idea #1: 

**"Race, Poverty, and Policing in Chicago: Analyzing the Socioeconomic Roots of Crime, Over-Policing in Marginalized Communities"** 


**Goal:** Demonstrate how systemic issues create a feedback loop where poverty (which is intertwined with race) leads to more police interactions, resulting in higher arrest rates for minor infractions. With this project, using Chicago, a microcosm representing the broader dynamics of racial and socioeconomic disparities in policing in the U.S, I hope to highlight how these dynamics disproportionately affect Black communities, inflating crime statistics and criminalizing poverty. 

**Why this matters:** Many fail to grasp the deeper context behind statistics showing higher conviction and incarceration rates for Black individuals, which reinforces harmful stereotypes that portray Black people as inherently more violent and criminal. Too often, crime data is oversimplified, failing to account for longstanding systemic issues, such as the over-policing of marginalized communities, economic disparities, and racism. Through this project I want to bridge that gap by providing a data-driven narrative that explins why these disparities exist and persist. 

## Working Idea #2: 

**"Race, Poverty, and Policing in Chicago: Analyzing the Socioeconomic Roots of Crime, Over-Policing, and Wrongful Convictions in Marginalized Communities"** 

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate how systemic issues create a feedback loop where poverty (which is intertwined with race) leads to more police interactions, resulting in higher arrest rates for minor infractions. This project uses Chicago as a representation of broader dynamics in the U.S., focusing on how these patterns disproportionately affect Black communities, inflating crime statistics and, in some cases, leading to wrongful convictions that criminalize poverty and perpetuate racial injustice.

**Why This Matters:**  
Many fail to grasp the deeper context behind statistics showing higher conviction and incarceration rates for Black individuals, reinforcing harmful stereotypes that portray Black people as inherently more violent and criminal. Crime data is often oversimplified, failing to account for systemic factors like over-policing, economic disparities, and racial bias. By exploring both the over-policing of marginalized communities and the frequency of wrongful convictions, this project aims to provide a nuanced, data-driven narrative that explains why these disparities exist and persist.

## Considerations for Including Wrongful Conviction Data

I'm currently contemplating whether to expand the project to include data on wrongful convictions and exonerations, or to keep the focus on over-policing and criminalization of poverty. Here are some of the factors influencing this decision:

- **Pros of Including Wrongful Convictions**:
  - Adds depth to the project by showcasing the long-term impacts of systemic bias, including how over-policing can lead to wrongful convictions.
  - Strengthens the narrative by illustrating the severe consequences of systemic issues beyond immediate interactions with police. 
   - Coincides with my current internship, where I work firsthand with exonerated and currently incarcerated individuals. Aligning this project with my work experience would provide valuable insights and make the subject even more personally meaningful.

- **Cons of Including Wrongful Convictions**:
  - Increased complexity and workload, as managing multiple datasets may require additional data wrangling and cleaning.
  - Potential dilution of focus, as balancing both over-policing and wrongful convictions might make it challenging to tell a clear, cohesive story.
