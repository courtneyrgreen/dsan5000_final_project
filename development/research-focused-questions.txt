Systemic Dynamics & Historical Context

How have historical factors contributed to racial disparities in policing in the U.S., and what parallels exist in the data specific to Chicago?
Which studies provide a historical overview of policing policies and their impact on Black communities?
Data Points and Statistical Analysis

What specific data points and statistical findings are available on the over-policing of Black communities?
Are there significant differences in arrest rates, search rates, or use-of-force incidents between Black and White populations in Chicago or similar urban areas?
What patterns emerge in the datasets around wrongful convictions and the impact of over-policing on these rates?
Economic Impact and Feedback Loops

What role does economic disadvantage play in the over-policing of Black communities, and how does this feedback loop manifest in crime statistics?
Are there existing economic analyses or data on how poverty and unemployment correlate with higher police interaction rates?
Psychological and Social Effects

What documented psychological or social effects are associated with frequent police contact and surveillance within Black communities?
Are there studies discussing the community’s perception of law enforcement and how this perception impacts cooperation in crime prevention?
Effectiveness of Community Policing & Reform Efforts

Have any specific reform initiatives, such as reallocating police budgets to community services or implementing community policing, shown measurable success in reducing over-policing?
What insights are provided into how community-based approaches differ in effectiveness across demographics?
Which reform strategies are consistently recommended by academic sources as most effective in reducing racial disparities in policing?
Media and Public Perception

What evidence exists on the media’s role in shaping public perceptions of Black communities in relation to crime?
How do different studies suggest media coverage contributes to or detracts from public support for police reform?
Are there specific examples where media portrayal led to changes in policy or public sentiment regarding policing?
Impact-Focused Questions for Reform and Policy Development
Policy Recommendations and Practicality

What policy changes are recommended to reduce racial bias and improve police accountability?
How feasible are these recommendations for practical implementation, especially in highly-policed urban areas like Chicago?
Measuring Success and Outcomes of Reforms

How have the outcomes of specific reforms been measured (e.g., crime rates, arrest demographics, community trust), and what has been the general success rate?
What metrics are most commonly used to evaluate police reform, and how do they reflect on long-term systemic change?
Legal and Ethical Considerations

What legal precedents or frameworks are in place to protect marginalized communities from over-policing?
What ethical discussions arise around the collection of race-based data in policing, and how do scholars suggest handling this sensitively?
Cross-Comparative Analyses

How does Chicago compare to other U.S. cities in terms of racial disparities in policing, and what lessons can be drawn from cities with lower disparities?
Are there international examples of successful anti-racism policing strategies that could be applied in Chicago or the broader U.S.?
Targeted Questions for Synthesizing Your Findings
Identifying Gaps and Future Research Needs

What areas related to over-policing and racial bias in policing are under-researched or insufficiently addressed in current literature?
Are there specific demographics (e.g., women, LGBTQ+, youth) within marginalized communities that are less studied in the context of over-policing?
Integrating Wrongful Conviction Data

How does the literature link wrongful convictions to patterns of over-policing and racial profiling, particularly within low-income Black communities?
Are there case studies or longitudinal analyses on wrongful convictions that highlight systemic issues within policing frameworks?
Longitudinal and Interdisciplinary Insights

What long-term studies (spanning 10+ years) have observed the effects of policing on Black communities, and what trends do they reveal?
Are there interdisciplinary insights (e.g., from sociology, psychology, and criminology) that would provide a more holistic understanding of over-policing impacts?
