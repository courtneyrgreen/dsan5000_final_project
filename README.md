# **DSAN5000 Final Project:** <br/> *Cell Block Tango: Steps of Misconduct, Over-Policing, and Cycles of Racial Injustice in Chicagoâ€™s Criminal Justice System*

This project was developed for **DSAN-5000: Data Science and Analytics**, a first-year graduate-level course at Georgetown University. The goal of this project is to explore systemic issues in Illinoisâ€™ criminal justice system, with a focus on exonerations, arrests, and over-policing. The study leverages data science techniques to uncover patterns, analyze racial disparities, and identify the role of police misconduct in wrongful convictions.

Chicago serves as a critical case study due to its disproportionate share of exonerations and systemic failures. This portfolio presents a data-driven narrative, utilizing various datasets, machine learning models, and visualizations to highlight systemic injustice.
