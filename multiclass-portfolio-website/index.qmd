## Interests
Beyond the professional sphere, I’m most fulfilled by hobbies that blend creativity with a deep sense of exploration and discovery. Whether I’m delving into European monarchal history or crafting through embroidery and crochet, I enjoy activities that engage both my hands and my mind. I find the most joy in cooking and baking, where creativity meets intuition and curiosity. It’s a process of experimentation, adaptability, and creating something meaningful to share with others—a perfect balance of structure and spontaneity. This same fascination with shaping outcomes draws me to life simulation and narrative-driven games like *The Sims*, *Life is Strange*, and *Detroit: Become Human*. These games, much like cooking, require thoughtful decisions and invite you to explore how small choices can lead to vastly different results. I’m continually inspired by pursuits that challenge me to think creatively, build connections, and embrace new perspectives.
