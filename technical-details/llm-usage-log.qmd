title: "LLM usage log"

This page can serve as a "catch-all" for LLM use cases that don’t involve content creation, such as reformatting your own ideas, commenting code that you wrote, or proofreading text, PDF summarization.

LLM tools were used in the following way for the tasks below

## Brainstorming

* I came up with my initial, broad project idea of over-policing and the criminalization of race and poverty as it's a topic I've always been passionate about, however LLM helped me narrow down my topic to focus on a specific locality (e.g. Chicago). 

## Literature Review:  
* LLM tools were used extensively to streamline the literature review process. Specifically, I utilized ChatGPT to: 
  - Summarize key points from academic papers and credible news articles, making it easier to integrate multiple perspectives on over-policing, socioeconomic factors, and racial disparities in the criminal justice system.
  - Extract relevant data and highlight findings from each source, such as the impact of income inequality on crime rates, racial disparities in wrongful convictions, and community perceptions of policing.
  - Reorganize summaries and refine content to ensure a cohesive narrative for the literature review section, effectively condensing long, complex papers into concise, useful summaries that align with my project's goals.
  - Support citation management by providing brief summaries for each source, which I then used to create a more structured references file (`references.bib`).

* Using LLM for these tasks allowed me to efficiently review and synthesize a larger volume of literature, ensuring comprehensive coverage of critical studies relevant to my project's focus on race, poverty, and policing in Chicago.

## Writing: 

* proofreading 
* grammarly 
* i initially wrote a lot of my code prose explanatoions in first person before realizing research is I think suppose dto be in third person so I used hatgpt to convert


## Code: 

* Code commenting and explanatory documentation 
* used for geospatial eda - haven't learned that in class yet and am not in GIS

re-formating text with LLM tools.
Code explaination “describe what this code is doing in prose”
Text summarization
Proofreading
chatGPT for project brainstorming
Using LLM tools to comment your code qualifies as an acceptible use case in this project
