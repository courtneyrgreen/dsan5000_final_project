    "# Introduction and Motivation\n",
    "In this project, I set out to create a balanced dataset that would support supervised learning models for predicting the factors linked to exonerations. At the heart of this process is **counterfactual balancing**: building a dataset that includes exonerated individuals alongside a comparable group of non-exonerated individuals, drawn to reflect the broader incarcerated population in Illinois. This balance is critical—it allows the model to make fair and meaningful comparisons when identifying patterns and predictors of exoneration outcomes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Counterfactual Data?  \n",
    "Counterfactual data is a necessity when access to complete prison population records is unavailable. Since I don’t have access to a full dataset of all incarcerated individuals in Illinois and their exoneration statuses (e.g., 'exonerated', 'not exonerate'), I relied on counterfactuals to bridge the gap and construct a balanced dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind counterfactuals is simple: they allow us to ask *“what if?”* questions. For example: *What if an exonerated person had not been exonerated? Would their characteristics look similar to non-exonerated individuals?* Counterfactual data helps isolate these comparisons by holding everything else constant except the hypothetical condition—in this case, exoneration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in this [primer on counterfactuals](https://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/primer-ch4.pdf), a counterfactual statement operates on an unrealized “if” condition. The “if” portion, also known as the antecedent, frames the comparison: exonerated individuals versus those who weren’t. This approach is powerful because it reduces bias and ensures that the model is trained on data that is reliable, balanced, and representative. [@pearl2016counterfactuals]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acknowledgments\n",
    "The implementation of this counterfactual data balancing relied heavily on expert guidance and code contributions from <a href=\"https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/003Hp00002jMlEDIA0/jeffrey-jacobs\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Jeff Jacobs</a>. His insights and support were invaluable in refining the methodology and making this process possible.  "

    "# Narrowing to Incarcerated Population \n",
    "To focus on the incarcerated population in Illinois, the dataset was filtered to include only relevant columns that captured key demographic details, such as total incarcerated populations broken down by race—White, Black, and Latino. This step ensured that the precise subset of data needed for balancing was used while also laying the groundwork for simulating representative draws from the Illinois incarcerated population.  "

The resulting DataFrame provides a clean and structured foundation for further analysis.  \n",

    "This balanced dataset can now be used for **supervised learning** tasks, such as:  \n",
    "- **Predicting Exoneration Factors:** Training machine learning models to identify the characteristics most associated with exoneration outcomes.  \n",
    "- **Comparative Analysis:** Exploring differences in demographics, geographic distribution, or other variables between exonerated and non-exonerated individuals.  \n",
    "- **Visualization and Insights:** Mapping trends or disparities across counties and racial groups to better understand systemic patterns in wrongful convictions.  \n",
