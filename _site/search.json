Removing them ensures the dataset remains robust and manageable without introducing bias from imputation.\n\n# Drop columns with excessive missing values \ndf_original = df.copy()\ndf.drop(columns = ['OM Tags', 'F/MFE', 'ILD', 'P/FA', 'DNA', 'MWID', 'FC','OM'], inplace = True)\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand the distribution of missing values, a heatmap is generated. This visualization provides a clear overview of where missing values occur, helping to decide which columns or rows to address in subsequent steps.\n\n\nA heatmap is generated to visualize the extent of missing data before cleaning. Columns with a high proportion of missing values are easily identifiable, providing a clear justification for their removal.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Heatmap of missing data before cleaning\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.heatmap(df_original.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')\nplt.title('Heatmap of Missing Data (Before Cleaning)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA second heatmap is generated after cleaning to confirm that all unnecessary columns with excessive missing values have been removed. This ensures the dataset is now complete and ready for further analysis.\n\n# Heatmap of missing data after cleaning\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')\nplt.title('Heatmap of Missing Data (After Cleaning)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough this process, all missing data was evaluated and either addressed or removed. Columns with excessive missing values were dropped, while remaining data was retained to ensure completeness and reliability. The resulting dataset is now free of significant missing data, ready for further cleaning and analysis steps.\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the broader data cleaning process, I decided to narrow the scope of my research question to Illinois. This choice was intentional to focus the analysis on a specific region, ensuring that the findings are both relevant and manageable within the scope of this project. Illinois was selected because of its extensive record of exoneration cases, particularly in Cook County, which provides a valuable dataset for analyzing systemic issues within the criminal justice system. Chicago, in particular, has long been associated with significant racial disparities and deeply entrenched problems in policing and prosecution, making it a critical focal point for this analysis. By focusing on Illinois, the dataset remains consistent in terms of jurisdictional laws and practices, allowing for a more accurate and concentrated exploration of patterns and trends in over-policing and wrongful convictions. This regional focus highlights the broader systemic failures of the criminal justice system while enabling a detailed examination of one of the most historically inequitable jurisdictions in terms of racial justice.\n\n\nTo isolate Illinois cases, the dataset was filtered by the state column, retaining only rows where the value matched “Illinois.” This step reduced the dataset to 548 rows, making it more manageable for analysis and visualization. Below is a preview of the filtered dataset:\n\n# Filter Data for Illinois \ndf = df[df['State'] == 'Illinois']\nprint(\"Number of exonerees for Illinois subset: \" , df.shape[0]) \ndf.head()\n\nNumber of exonerees for Illinois subset:  548\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\nFirst Name\nAge\nRace\nSex\nState\nCounty\nTags\nWorst Crime Display\nSentence\nPosting Date\nDate of Exoneration\nDate of 1st Conviction\nDate of Release\n\n\n\n\n1\nAbbott\nCinque\n19.0\nBlack\nMale\nIllinois\nCook\nCIU;#IO;#NC;#P\nDrug Possession or Sale\nProbation\n2/14/22\n2/1/22\n3/25/08\n3/25/08\n\n\n3\nAbernathy\nChristopher\n17.0\nWhite\nMale\nIllinois\nCook\nCIU;#CV;#H;#IO;#JV;#SA\nMurder\nLife without parole\n2/13/15\n2/11/15\n1/15/87\n2/11/15\n\n\n5\nAbrego\nEruby\n20.0\nHispanic\nMale\nIllinois\nCook\nCDC;#H;#IO\nMurder\n90 years\n8/25/22\n7/21/22\n9/22/04\n7/21/22\n\n\n10\nAdams\nDemetris\n22.0\nBlack\nMale\nIllinois\nCook\nCIU;#IO;#NC;#P\nDrug Possession or Sale\n1 year\n4/13/20\n2/11/20\n9/8/04\n12/26/04\n\n\n15\nAdams\nKenneth\n22.0\nBlack\nMale\nIllinois\nCook\nCDC;#H;#IO;#JI;#SA\nMurder\n75 years\n8/29/11\n7/2/96\n10/20/78\n6/14/96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure consistency and simplify future operations, all column names were standardized by converting them to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores (_). This transformation enhances readability, aligns with Python’s naming conventions, and makes column names easier to reference in code. For example, a column originally labeled First Name is now first_name.\n\n# Standardize column names by converting to lowercase and replacing spaces with '_'\ndf.columns = df.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')\nprint(df.columns)\n\nIndex(['last_name', 'first_name', 'age', 'race', 'sex', 'state', 'county',\n       'tags', 'worst_crime_display', 'sentence', 'posting_date',\n       'date_of_exoneration', 'date_of_1st_conviction', 'date_of_release'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the sex column was converted to lowercase to maintain uniformity across textual data. This step ensures that values like “Male” and “male” are treated equivalently during analysis, reducing potential discrepancies caused by case sensitivity.\n\n# Convert sex values to lowercase \ndf['sex'] = df['sex'].str.lower()\ndf['sex'].head()\n\n1     male\n3     male\n5     male\n10    male\n15    male\nName: sex, dtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccurate data type formatting is essential for effective analysis. This section ensures that all variables are correctly identified as numerical, categorical, or date-time types and that they are ready for further processing.\n\n# Display data types for each column\nprint(df.dtypes)\n\nlast_name                  object\nfirst_name                 object\nage                       float64\nrace                       object\nsex                        object\nstate                      object\ncounty                     object\ntags                       object\nworst_crime_display        object\nsentence                   object\nposting_date               object\ndate_of_exoneration        object\ndate_of_1st_conviction     object\ndate_of_release            object\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\nUpon reviewing the data types, it was noted that several columns, such as Last Name, First Name, Race, State, County, and Worst Crime Display, were classified as object. While this is acceptable for textual data, converting these columns to string ensures consistency and prevents potential issues when performing text-specific operations. This transformation also allows for better optimization and clarity in the data processing pipeline. The changes were necessary to standardize the dataset and ensure compatibility with downstream analysis tasks.\n\n# Convert relevant columns to string type\nstring_columns = ['last_name', 'first_name', 'race', 'sex', 'state', 'county', 'worst_crime_display']\ndf[string_columns] = df[string_columns].astype('string')\n\n# Check updated data types\nprint(df.dtypes)\n\nlast_name                 string[python]\nfirst_name                string[python]\nage                              float64\nrace                      string[python]\nsex                       string[python]\nstate                     string[python]\ncounty                    string[python]\ntags                              object\nworst_crime_display       string[python]\nsentence                          object\nposting_date                      object\ndate_of_exoneration               object\ndate_of_1st_conviction            object\ndate_of_release                   object\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\nAll date columns (posting_date, date_of_exoneration, date_of_1st_conviction, date_of_release) are converted to datetime format. This transformation ensures consistency and allows for easier time-based calculations, such as measuring the time between conviction and exoneration.\n\n# Convert date columns into datetime format\nfor col in ['posting_date', 'date_of_exoneration', 'date_of_1st_conviction', 'date_of_release']:\n    try:\n        # Attempt to convert with explicit format (MM/DD/YY)\n        df[col] = pd.to_datetime(df[col], format='%m/%d/%y', errors='coerce')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error processing column {col}: {e}\")\n        df[col] = pd.to_datetime(df[col], errors='coerce')  # Fallback to auto-detection\n\nprint(df[['posting_date', 'date_of_exoneration', 'date_of_1st_conviction', 'date_of_release']].head())\n\n   posting_date date_of_exoneration date_of_1st_conviction date_of_release\n1    2022-02-14          2022-02-01             2008-03-25      2008-03-25\n3    2015-02-13          2015-02-11             1987-01-15      2015-02-11\n5    2022-08-25          2022-07-21             2004-09-22      2022-07-21\n10   2020-04-13          2020-02-11             2004-09-08      2004-12-26\n15   2011-08-29          1996-07-02             1978-10-20      1996-06-14\n\n\n\n# Check updated data types\nprint(df.dtypes)\n\nlast_name                 string[python]\nfirst_name                string[python]\nage                              float64\nrace                      string[python]\nsex                       string[python]\nstate                     string[python]\ncounty                    string[python]\ntags                              object\nworst_crime_display       string[python]\nsentence                          object\nposting_date              datetime64[ns]\ndate_of_exoneration       datetime64[ns]\ndate_of_1st_conviction    datetime64[ns]\ndate_of_release           datetime64[ns]\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sentence column contains textual descriptions of sentencing outcomes, including terms like “Life without parole,” “Death,” or a specified number of years. To facilitate analysis, I transform this column into a numerical format (sentence_in_years) by converting life sentences and probation to placeholder values and handling ranges or mixed units (e.g., years and months).\n\n# Print unique sentencing values for a better idea on how to best clean column \nunique_sentences = df['sentence'].unique()\nprint(unique_sentences)\n\n['Probation' 'Life without parole' '90 years' '1 year' '75 years'\n '30 years' '55 years' '2 years' '3 years' '6 years' '45 years'\n '1 year and 6 months' '50 years' '60 years' 'Life' '80 years' '18 years'\n '4 years' '85 years' '20 years' '35 years' '2 years and 6 months'\n '82 years' '12 years' 'Not sentenced' '22 years' '32 years' 'Death'\n '5 years' '40 years' '25 years' '26 years' '4 years and 6 months'\n '9 years' '48 years' '30 days' '84 years' '3 months and 25 days'\n '2 years and 2 months' '3 months' '44 years' '6 months' '25 to 50 years'\n '29 years' '23 years' '31 years' '11 years' '8 years' '24 years'\n '3 years and four months' '42 years' '3 years and 6 months' '65 years'\n '76 years' '15 years' '50 to Life' '86 years' '70 years' '28 years'\n '13 years' '47 years' '36 years' '18 months' '1 year and 4 months'\n '8 years and 6 months' '6 years and 6 months' '58 years' '95 years'\n '7 years' '34 years' '62 years' '27 years' '69 years' '57 years'\n '50 to 100 years' '4 months' '4 years and 3 months' '37 years' '10 years'\n '67 years' '46 years' '17 years' '10 to 22 years' '6 years and 7 months'\n '5 years and 6 months' '2 Years']\n\n\n\n\nThe sentence column is cleaned to convert textual descriptions into numerical values: 1. Probation and Not Sentenced are set to 0. 2. Life sentences and the death penalty are represented as 100 for placeholder analysis. 3. Ranges (e.g., “25 to 50 years”) are averaged to a single value. 4. Years and months are combined into total years for uniformity.\nThis standardization facilitates meaningful comparisons and quantitative analysis of sentencing patterns.\n\nimport re\ndef clean_sentence(value):\n    \"\"\" Cleans the 'sentence' column values to numeric years for numerical EDA \n    - Probation is represented as 0.\n    - 'Not sentenced' is converted to np.nan.\n    - 'Life' and 'Death' sentences are represented as 100 (placeholder).\n    - Years and months are converted to a numeric value in years. \"\"\"\n\n    if value == 'Probation':\n        return 0\n    elif value == 'Not sentenced':\n        return np.nan  # NaN for not sentenced\n    elif 'Life' in value or value == 'Death':\n        return 100  # Placeholder for life sentences or death penalty\n    elif 'year' in value or 'month' in value:\n\n        # Handles ranges like '25 to 50 years'\n        if 'to' in value:\n            years = [int(num) for num in re.findall(r'\\d+', value)]\n            return sum(years) / len(years)  # Average the range \n        \n        # Handle \"X years and Y months\"\n        elif 'and' in value:\n            numbers = [float(num) for num in re.findall(r'\\d+', value)]\n            if len(numbers) == 2:  # Both years and months are present\n                years, months = numbers\n                return years + (months / 12)  # Convert months to years\n            elif len(numbers) == 1:  # Only one number is present\n                return numbers[0]  # Treat it as years\n            \n        # Handle only months or only years\n        elif 'months' in value:\n            months = int(re.search(r'\\d+', value).group())\n            return months / 12  # Convert months to years\n        else:  # Only years\n            return int(re.search(r'\\d+', value).group())\n    else:\n        return np.nan  # Anything unexpected as None\n    \ndf['sentence_in_years'] = df['sentence'].apply(clean_sentence)\n\n# Check results\ndf[['sentence', 'sentence_in_years']].head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsentence\nsentence_in_years\n\n\n\n\n1\nProbation\n0.0\n\n\n3\nLife without parole\n100.0\n\n\n5\n90 years\n90.0\n\n\n10\n1 year\n1.0\n\n\n15\n75 years\n75.0\n\n\n21\nProbation\n0.0\n\n\n22\nProbation\n0.0\n\n\n24\n30 years\n30.0\n\n\n25\n55 years\n55.0\n\n\n45\n1 year\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Check updated data types\nprint(df.dtypes)\n\nlast_name                 string[python]\nfirst_name                string[python]\nage                              float64\nrace                      string[python]\nsex                       string[python]\nstate                     string[python]\ncounty                    string[python]\ntags                              object\nworst_crime_display       string[python]\nsentence                          object\nposting_date              datetime64[ns]\ndate_of_exoneration       datetime64[ns]\ndate_of_1st_conviction    datetime64[ns]\ndate_of_release           datetime64[ns]\nsentence_in_years                float64\ndtype: object\n\n\nAfter transforming the sentence column into a numerical format, the new column, sentence_in_years is now represented as a float64, which aligns with the desired structure for numerical analysis. This conversion allows for quantitative exploration of the sentencing data, such as aggregations and comparisons, during later stages of analysis. The original sentence column is retained for reference purposes, as it preserves the detailed textual descriptions that might be useful for contextual insights. The tags column will be addressed later, so for now the datatype may remain as an object.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tags column contains important categorical information about each exoneration case. To make this data more useful for analysis, I transformed the column into multiple binary columns, where each tag indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a specific feature. Additionally, I created a tag_sum column to capture the total number of tags associated with each case, providing a quick summary metric.\nThe cleaning process involved the following steps: 1. Removing Unnecessary Characters: Unwanted characters such as # were removed, and delimiters were standardized to ensure consistency in the data. 2. Splitting Tags: The tags column was split into individual values to facilitate binary encoding. 3. Renaming Binary Columns: Each binary column was renamed using clear and descriptive labels by mapping the original tags to their definitions. This mapping process translated short tag codes into their full meanings, improving interpretability.

    "text": "Before diving into the broader data cleaning process, I decided to narrow the scope of my research question to Illinois. This choice was intentional to focus the analysis on a specific region, ensuring that the findings are both relevant and manageable within the scope of this project. Illinois was selected because of its extensive record of exoneration cases, particularly in Cook County, which provides a valuable dataset for analyzing systemic issues within the criminal justice system. Chicago, in particular, has long been associated with significant racial disparities and deeply entrenched problems in policing and prosecution, making it a critical focal point for this analysis. By focusing on Illinois, the dataset remains consistent in terms of jurisdictional laws and practices, allowing for a more accurate and concentrated exploration of patterns and trends in over-policing and wrongful convictions. This regional focus highlights the broader systemic failures of the criminal justice system while enabling a detailed examination of one of the most historically inequitable jurisdictions in terms of racial justice.\n\n\nTo isolate Illinois cases, the dataset was filtered by the state column, retaining only rows where the value matched “Illinois.” This step reduced the dataset to 548 rows, making it more manageable for analysis and visualization.

While this is acceptable for textual data, converting these columns to string ensures consistency and prevents potential issues when performing text-specific operations. This transformation also allows for better optimization and clarity in the data processing pipeline. The changes were necessary to standardize the dataset and ensure compatibility with downstream analysis tasks.\n\n# Convert relevant columns to string type\nstring_columns = ['last_name', 'first_name', 'race', 'sex', 'state', 'county', 'worst_crime_display']\ndf[string_columns] = df[string_columns].astype('string')\n\n# Check updated data types\nprint(df.dtypes)\n\nlast_name                 string[python]\nfirst_name                string[python]\nage                              float64\nrace                      string[python]\nsex                       string[python]\nstate                     string[python]\ncounty                    string[python]\ntags                              object\nworst_crime_display       string[python]\nsentence                          object\nposting_date                      object\ndate_of_exoneration               object\ndate_of_1st_conviction            object\ndate_of_release                   object\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\nAll date columns (posting_date, date_of_exoneration, date_of_1st_conviction, date_of_release) are converted to datetime format.

Probation and Not Sentenced are set to 0. 2. Life sentences and the death penalty are represented as 100 for placeholder analysis. 3.

The original sentence column is retained for reference purposes, as it preserves the detailed textual descriptions that might be useful for contextual insights. The tags column will be addressed later, so for now the datatype may remain as an object."

    "text": "The tags column contains important categorical information about each exoneration case. To make this data more useful for analysis, I transformed the column into multiple binary columns, where each tag indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a specific feature. Additionally, I created a tag_sum column to capture the total number of tags associated with each case, providing a quick summary metric.\nThe cleaning process involved the following steps: 1. Removing Unnecessary Characters: Unwanted characters such as # were removed, and delimiters were standardized to ensure consistency in the data. 2. Splitting Tags: The tags column was split into individual values to facilitate binary encoding. 3. Renaming Binary Columns: Each binary column was renamed using clear and descriptive labels by mapping the original tags to their definitions. This mapping process translated short tag codes into their full meanings, improving interpretability. For reference, the definitions of the tags are based on the descriptions provided on the National Registry of Exonerations: Exoneration Detail List . 4. Adding a tag_sum Column: A new column was created to calculate the total number of tags for each case, enabling easier analysis of case complexity.\nThis transformation ensures the data is well-structured and ready for exploratory analysis, providing detailed insights into the systemic patterns in exoneration cases.\n\n# Clean tags column by removing unecesary '#' from tags column\ndf['tags'] = df['tags'].str.replace('#', '', regex=False).str.replace(\";\", \",\")\n\n\n# Define the mapping for tags\ntag_mapping = {\n    \"A\": \"arson\",\n    \"BM\": \"bitemark\",\n    \"CDC\": \"co_defendant_confessed\",\n    \"CIU\": \"conviction_integrity_unit\",\n    \"CSH\": \"child_sex_abuse_hysteria_case\",\n    \"CV\": \"child_victim\",\n    \"F\": \"female_exoneree\",\n    \"FED\": \"federal_case\",\n    \"H\": \"homicide\",\n    \"IO\": \"innocence_organization\",\n    \"JI\": \"jailhouse_informant\",\n    \"JV\": \"juvenile_defendant\",\n    \"M\": \"misdemeanor\",\n    \"NC\": \"no_crime_case\",\n    \"P\": \"guilty_plea_case\",\n    \"PH\": \"posthumous_exoneration\",\n    \"SA\": \"sexual_assault\",\n    \"SBS\": \"shaken_baby_syndrome_case\",\n    \"PR\": \"prosecutor_misconduct\",\n    \"OF\": \"police_officer_misconduct\",\n    \"FA\": \"forensic_analyst_misconduct\",\n    \"CW\": \"child_welfare_worker_misconduct\",\n    \"WH\": \"withheld_exculpatory_evidence\",\n    \"NW\": \"misconduct_that_is_not_withholding_evidence\",\n    \"KP\": \"knowingly_permitting_perjury\",\n    \"WT\": \"witness_tampering_or_misconduct_interrogating_co_defendant\",\n    \"INT\": \"misconduct_in_interrogation_of_exoneree\",\n    \"PJ\": \"perjury_by_official\",\n    \"PL\": \"prosecutor_lied_in_court\"\n}\n\n# Ensure the 'tags' column is a list of tags (split if needed)\ndf['tags'] = df['tags'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',') if isinstance(x, str) else x)\n\n# Create a binary column for each tag\nfor tag in tag_mapping.keys():\n    df[tag] = df['tags'].apply(lambda x: 1 if isinstance(x, list) and tag in x else 0)\n\n# Rename the binary columns using the tag_mapping dictionary\ndf.rename(columns=tag_mapping, inplace=True)\n\n# Create `tag_sum` column to count the total number of tags for each exoneree\ndf['tag_sum'] = df[list(tag_mapping.values())].sum(axis=1)\n\n#Drop tag columns\ndf.drop(columns=['tags'], inplace=True)\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlast_name\nfirst_name\nage\nrace\nsex\nstate\ncounty\nworst_crime_display\nsentence\nposting_date\ndate_of_exoneration\ndate_of_1st_conviction\ndate_of_release\nsentence_in_years\narson\nbitemark\nco_defendant_confessed\nconviction_integrity_unit\nchild_sex_abuse_hysteria_case\nchild_victim\nfemale_exoneree\nfederal_case\nhomicide\ninnocence_organization\njailhouse_informant\njuvenile_defendant\nmisdemeanor\nno_crime_case\nguilty_plea_case\nposthumous_exoneration\nsexual_assault\nshaken_baby_syndrome_case\nprosecutor_misconduct\npolice_officer_misconduct\nforensic_analyst_misconduct\nchild_welfare_worker_misconduct\nwithheld_exculpatory_evidence\nmisconduct_that_is_not_withholding_evidence\nknowingly_permitting_perjury\nwitness_tampering_or_misconduct_interrogating_co_defendant\nmisconduct_in_interrogation_of_exoneree\nperjury_by_official\nprosecutor_lied_in_court\ntag_sum\n\n\n\n\n1\nAbbott\nCinque\n19.0\nBlack\nmale\nIllinois\nCook\nDrug Possession or Sale\nProbation\n2022-02-14\n2022-02-01\n2008-03-25\n2008-03-25\n0.0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n\n\n3\nAbernathy\nChristopher\n17.0\nWhite\nmale\nIllinois\nCook\nMurder\nLife without parole\n2015-02-13\n2015-02-11\n1987-01-15\n2015-02-11\n100.0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n6\n\n\n5\nAbrego\nEruby\n20.0\nHispanic\nmale\nIllinois\nCook\nMurder\n90 years\n2022-08-25\n2022-07-21\n2004-09-22\n2022-07-21\n90.0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n\n\n10\nAdams\nDemetris\n22.0\nBlack\nmale\nIllinois\nCook\nDrug Possession or Sale\n1 year\n2020-04-13\n2020-02-11\n2004-09-08\n2004-12-26\n1.0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n\n\n15\nAdams\nKenneth\n22.0\nBlack\nmale\nIllinois\nCook\nMurder\n75 years\n2011-08-29\n1996-07-02\n1978-10-20\n1996-06-14\n75.0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5"

    "text": "We believe that the adoption of LLM tools is inevitable and will be an important skill for success in your future career. Therefore, appropriate and acceptable use of LLM tools is encouraged for this project. Use them to accelerate your workflow and learning, but not as a replacement for critical thinking and understanding. Carefully review and process their output, use them judiciously, and avoid bloating your text with LLM-generated content. Overusing these tools often degrades the quality of your work rather than enhancing it.\nRemember the following guidelines:\n\nUse common sense: If you feel like you’re doing something questionable, you probably are. A good test is to ask yourself, “Would I openly tell the professor or classmates what I’m doing right now?” If the answer is no, you’re probably doing something you shouldn’t.\nCite your LLM use cases: Always cite when and how you’ve used LLM tools. This is a requirement for the project.\nIs your use helping you grow professionally?: If your use of LLM tools is making you a more competent, efficient, and knowledgeable professional, you’re probably using them in an appropriate manner. If you’re using them as a shortcut to avoid work and gain free time, you’re using them incorrectly.\n\n\n\nALWAY CITE CONTENT OR IDEAS TAKEN FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES: e.g. websites, llm tools, papers\nALWAYS BE TRANSPARENT WHEN YOU ARE USING LLM TOOLS:\nPlease follow these guidelines:\n\nGeneral Tasks: Create and regularly update a dedicated LLM Transparency page to document how you are using LLM tools.\n\nThis page can serve as a “catch-all” for use cases that don’t involve content creation, such as reformatting your own ideas, commenting code that you wrote, or proofreading text, PDF summarization.\n\nContent Creation: If non-original content (code or text) is generated by an LLM, you must also cite it on specific pages, just like any external source.\n\nFor non-original content, always provide a citation.\nCite the LLM tool after each chunk of text or code it generates, using a BibTeX. For example1\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Various useful non-LLM research tools can be found here at the following link\n\nTraditional research tools\n\nYou can use LLM tools for the following use cases\n\nAI research tools\nThese include\n\nre-formating text with LLM tools.\nCode explaination “describe what this code is doing in prose”\nText summarization\nProofreading\n\nchatGPT for project brainstorming\nUsing LLM tools to comment your code qualifies as an acceptible use case in this project. You can also use or code re-formatters such as black to increase the readability of your code.\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT use ChatGPT or other LLM tools to write large portions of your text or code.\n\n\nIf it is clear that you have used LLM tools to write large portions of your code or text, your grade will reflect this, likely in the range of 0% to 50% of the total points, depending on the quality of the work. LLM outputs still require significant polishing to fit into a well-written, cohesive narrative. If it is evident that you simply inserted large portions of LLM-generated content into your assignment without taking the time to refine it into a high-quality submission, your grade will reflect this, even if the usage does not rise to the level of plagiarism.\n\n\n\nIn extreme cases,the following actions will occur.\n\nOne-on-One Investigation: You will meet with department faculty for a thorough review of your project. You will be asked to explain your work in detail, including what specific chunks of code do, why you made certain decisions, and how you reached your conclusions.\nReferral to the Honor Council: If, during this meeting, it is determined that you do not have sufficient understanding of the content that you claimed to have created, the case will be documented and sent to the honor council.

    "text": "Remember, slow and steady wins the race\nMaking steady, incremental progress on a large project generally makes it more manageable. Rushing to throw something together under a tight deadline often turns the process into a nightmare.\n\n\n\nThis is a graduate-level class, so each project should be viewed as specifications, not simple step-by-step requirements. Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable.\n\n\n\n“Data science” is essentially a collection of useful computational and mathematical skills (statistics, cloud computing, machine learning, coding, etc). However, to maximize your effectiveness, these skills should be applied to a domain of interest (e.g., materials science, finance, healthcare, etc). Focusing and learning about a particular domain will help you specialize and make you more marketable.\nThat beind said, don’t worry about choosing the “perfect” domain—it’s always possible to pivot later, as many of the skills learned, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and self-education, are transferable across all fields.\n\n\n\nImpact in science refers to the significance and influence of research, often measured by metrics like citations, impact factor of journals, and indices like h-index. These metrics reflect how widely recognized and valuable the work is within the scientific community.

You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important.\n\n\n\n80-20 Rule: This rule of thumb suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of causes. In other words, a small number of key factors drive the majority of outcomes. This principle applies to project management, where a few critical steps or decisions often determine the success of a project.\nFor example, it might take one week of steady work (30-40 hours) to complete 80% of a project, while the final 20% could take an additional four weeks.\n\nProjects tend to expand to fill the time available. No creative project—whether a book, song, poem, or paper—is ever truly 100% complete. There is an asymptotic limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and true perfection is unattainable.

Strive to take this project as far as possible, but remember to stop and “call it done” at some point.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations are a critical component of your portfolio. Use them strategically to support your narrative. The more visual representations of your data, the better—higher-quality visualizations will result in a higher grade.

    "text": "This is a graduate-level class, so each project should be viewed as specifications, not simple step-by-step requirements. Graduate-level work must be creative, individualized, and of high quality. To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial. While it’s important to work independently for at least 10–20 minutes, if you’re still stuck after 30 minutes, seek help. Being resourceful is important, but knowing when to ask for assistance is equally valuable."

    "text": "The study by Boehme, Cann, and Isom (2022) provides an in-depth examination of how race, ethnicity, and community characteristics influence public perceptions of policing, with a focus on both over- and under-policing. This research is highly relevant to my project on the intersection of race, poverty, and policing in Chicago, offering insights into how community-level factors contribute to divergent policing experiences1.\n\n\n\nThe Over-Under-Policing Paradox in Marginalized Communities: Boehme et al. highlight the duality of policing in marginalized communities, where residents often feel simultaneously over-policed through aggressive surveillance and under-policed in terms of protection and support. This paradox aligns with my project’s goal of investigating systemic biases in policing, revealing how this dual dynamic fosters a feedback loop of distrust and isolation from law enforcement1.\nRace as a Predictor of Perceptions: The study demonstrates that race consistently predicts perceptions of policing, with Black and Latinx communities reporting higher levels of over-policing regardless of economic conditions or other neighborhood factors. This finding supports the view that systemic racial biases in policing are pervasive, directly impacting Black and Latinx residents’ lived experiences. This insight strengthens my project’s focus on understanding the racialized nature of policing in Chicago1.\nPolicy Recommendations for Community-Based Reforms: Boehme and colleagues advocate for culturally sensitive reforms to improve police-community relations. Suggested reforms include adopting community-oriented policing models, reallocating resources to social services, and using non-police responders for non-violent incidents. These recommendations align with my project’s exploration of solutions to address both over- and under-policing by reimagining the role of police within marginalized communities1.\n\n\n\n\nBoehme et al. utilize data from the PHDCN (Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods) Community Survey, which provides a robust dataset that informs my own project’s focus on Chicago’s community dynamics.\n\nSurvey Scope and Sampling: The PHDCN survey includes 8,782 respondents across 343 neighborhood clusters in Chicago, derived from the city’s 847 census tracts. This sampling method offers a granular view of neighborhood-level factors, which is essential for understanding perceptions of policing across different community types in Chicago1.\nSurvey Timing and Context: Data collection for the PHDCN survey took place shortly after the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, capturing early responses to increased policing efforts. This context is crucial for understanding how federal policies may have intensified policing in Black communities, informing my analysis of systemic policing disparities in Chicago1.\n\n\n\n\nBoehme et al. use Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) to explore how individual and community characteristics shape perceptions of policing. Key analytical methods include:\n\nUnconditional Models: These models revealed that a significant portion of the variance in perceptions of over- and under-policing could be attributed to neighborhood-level factors, underscoring the importance of community context1.\nMeans-as-Outcomes Models: These models analyzed how neighborhood characteristics—such as economic disadvantage and ethnic diversity—influence residents’ perceptions of policing1.\nRandom Coefficient Models: Findings showed that race and ethnicity significantly impacted perceptions of policing, even after controlling for neighborhood factors. This reinforces the racialized experiences of policing, supporting my project’s objective to highlight the socio-economic roots of policing disparities in Chicago1.\n\n\n\n\nBoehme et al. provide valuable insights for understanding the dual impacts of over- and under-policing on marginalized communities. Here’s how these findings integrate with my project:\n\nReinforcing Racial Disparities in Policing: The study consistently shows that Black and Latinx residents report both over-policing and under-policing more frequently than their White counterparts. This underscores the racialized nature of policing and supports my project’s focus on the disproportionate impact of over-policing on Black communities in Chicago1.\nNeighborhood Characteristics as Predictors: Factors such as concentrated disadvantage and ethnic diversity emerged as significant predictors of policing perceptions. These findings are aligned with my project’s goal to explore the socio-economic roots of policing disparities, suggesting that addressing these factors may mitigate negative perceptions of policing in marginalized communities1.\nFeedback Loop Insight: The study highlights a feedback loop where high legal cynicism and under-policing exacerbate community distrust, fueling a cycle of under-service and over-surveillance. This dynamic is critical to my project’s focus on understanding how systemic issues perpetuate harmful feedback loops in marginalized communities1.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paper by Jones-Brown and Williams (2021) provides a comprehensive analysis of systemic over-policing in Black communities across the U.S., with findings that are particularly relevant for exploring the dynamics in Chicago2. This review highlights the key findings and data sources from the study, aligning with my focus on race, poverty, and policing.\n\n\n\nEmpirical Evidence of Racial Disparities: The authors reference a range of empirical studies that provide quantitative evidence on racial disparities in police interactions, such as traffic stops and arrests. Data shows that Black individuals experience higher rates of police encounters, including consent searches and minor stops, reinforcing stereotypes that link Black identity to criminality2.\nHigh-Profile Cases and Lived Experience: Citing cases such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the study captures the traumatic impact of over-policing on Black communities. These high-profile incidents serve as symbolic representations of a broader, systemic issue, fostering a legacy of fear and distrust toward law enforcement2.\nCommunity Distrust and Psychological Impact: Qualitative accounts from Black community members, including former Black police officers, reveal that recurrent negative police encounters create an environment of fear and mistrust. Black residents in areas such as Ferguson report feeling subjected to racialized social control, highlighting the psychosocial toll of over-policing in marginalized communities2.\nInfluence of Media Narratives: The study discusses how social media platforms have become a powerful tool for documenting police brutality and over-policing. Instances that gain traction online often reveal patterns of aggressive policing toward Black individuals, which the authors argue are reinforced by biased mainstream media portrayals that mischaracterize Black-led protests as violent, unlike predominantly White protests2.\nHistorical Context and Policy Analysis: The authors incorporate historical data, such as findings from the 1967 Katzenbach Report and the impact of the “War on Drugs,” to contextualize the persistence of racialized policing. These historical analyses reveal how longstanding policies have disproportionately impacted Black communities, establishing a precedent for examining similar issues in Chicago2.\nData-Driven Reform Recommendations: Drawing from statistical summaries, the study suggests reforms like eliminating consent searches without probable cause, reallocating police funds to community services, and removing racial identifiers in crime statistics. These proposed changes aim to transform policing practices and align with the goal of addressing the criminalization of poverty2.\n\n\n\n\nThe study integrates multiple data types to illustrate the scope of over-policing and its effects on Black communities:\n\nQuantitative Data: The authors use data on traffic stops, consent searches, and arrest rates from prior studies, highlighting a pattern of disproportionately high police encounters for Black individuals.\nQualitative Accounts: Narrative data from interviews with Black community members and former Black police officers bring a human perspective to the statistical data, demonstrating how over-policing affects personal safety and trust in law enforcement.\nSocial Media and Media Analysis: The authors examine social media documentation of police brutality and mainstream media portrayals of Black-led protests, emphasizing the role of media in reinforcing stereotypes that contribute to over-policing.\nHistorical Data: Referencing documents such as the 1967 Katzenbach Report, the study contextualizes racialized policing as a deeply rooted structural issue.\nPolicy Evaluations: By aggregating data from prior studies on policy impact, the authors evaluate the efficacy of different reforms, grounding their recommendations in empirical evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Racism in Policing: The study underscores that racial biases are deeply embedded within policing practices, leading to a disproportionately high number of police interactions with Black individuals. This structural racism aligns with my project’s goal of examining how race and poverty intersect to perpetuate over-policing2.\nFeedback Loop of Fear and Distrust: Frequent and negative interactions with police contribute to a feedback loop where Black communities are more likely to distrust law enforcement, further isolating these communities and reinforcing harmful stereotypes2.\nPolicy Reform Recommendations: The study’s suggestions, such as reallocating police funds to social services and prohibiting consent searches without probable cause, offer practical solutions to reduce racial disparities. These recommendations could inform policy proposals in my project aimed at addressing systemic biases in Chicago policing2.\n\n\n\n\nJones-Brown and Williams (2021) provide a foundational view of over-policing in Black communities, supporting my project by offering:\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Dual Perspective: The study’s combination of empirical data and personal accounts highlights the multifaceted nature of racial disparities in policing. This approach can inspire a dual focus in my project, utilizing both statistical data on over-policing in Chicago and narrative elements that illustrate its human impact.\nHistorical Context and Policy Analysis: By analyzing the historical roots of racialized policing, this paper strengthens my project’s examination of the socio-economic and racial factors that contribute to high crime and police interaction rates in marginalized communities.\nBlueprint for Systemic Reform: The study’s evidence-based reform suggestions, such as community-centered policing and policy reallocation, provide a practical framework for the solutions I plan to propose. These recommendations align with my goal of addressing over-policing in Chicago through systemic, community-driven reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study by Jacob Gesin, “Socioeconomic Determinants of Violent Crime Rates in the U.S.,” investigates how various socioeconomic factors influence violent crime rates, focusing on economic and structural disparities across racial groups in the U.S. This study’s findings provide critical context for my project’s focus on race, poverty, and policing in Chicago, especially as they pertain to the socioeconomic roots of crime in marginalized communities3.\n\n\n\nIncome Inequality and Violent Crime: Gesin’s analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between income inequality and violent crime rates, particularly in 2005 and 2009. States with greater income disparities were found to experience elevated crime rates, aligning with my project’s theme that economic inequalities contribute to higher crime rates in disadvantaged communities. This finding underscores the role of systemic inequality in perpetuating crime cycles in marginalized areas3.\nUnemployment and Violent Crime: Unemployment was shown to correlate with violent crime in two out of the three years studied. Gesin suggests that economic hardship and limited employment opportunities heighten frustration and aggression, which can manifest as violent crime. This insight supports my project’s examination of how economic deprivation in Black communities contributes to a feedback loop between poverty, crime, and increased police interactions3.\nFamily Structure and Social Stability: Gesin’s study highlights family structure as a factor influencing crime rates, with higher rates of family disruption (e.g., divorce, separation) linked to violent crime. This data suggests that family stability acts as a social control mechanism, deterring criminal behavior. For my project, this finding emphasizes the role of social structures in shaping crime rates, particularly in communities facing socioeconomic challenges3.\nRacial Disparities and Community Impact: Gesin found that racial composition significantly affected violent crime rates, with higher percentages of Black residents correlating with increased crime rates in 2012. This finding supports the idea that economically disadvantaged, racially segregated neighborhoods are more susceptible to violent crime, which could inform my focus on the unique challenges Black communities in Chicago face under systemic economic strain and over-policing3.\nEducation as a Protective Factor: Education emerged as a mitigating factor for crime, with higher levels of educational attainment generally associated with lower violent crime rates. Although this correlation varied in significance, it aligns with research suggesting that educational access reduces criminal behavior by improving job prospects and economic stability. This finding can support my project’s recommendations on promoting educational investment in marginalized communities as a potential crime prevention measure3.\n\n\n\n\nGesin’s study draws on data from several sources to analyze violent crime rates across the U.S.:\n\nU.S. Census Bureau and FBI UCR: Primary data was sourced from the Census Bureau and FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, covering crime and socioeconomic data from 2005, 2009, and 2012. These years capture different economic phases, offering insight into how economic shifts affect crime.\nSocioeconomic Variables:\n\nViolent Crime Rate (VCR): The dependent variable, capturing incidents of violent crime per 100,000 people.\nIncome Inequality (INC): Quantified by the Gini coefficient, illustrating disparities in wealth distribution.\nUnemployment (EMPLOY): Measured by the unemployment rate for individuals aged 16+, representing economic stability.\nFamily Structure (FAM): The percentage of families with divorced or separated parents, used to capture social stability.\nEducation (EDU): The proportion of individuals over 25 with some college education or higher.\nRacial Demographics (BPOP, WPOP, HPOP): Percentages of Black, White, and Hispanic populations, providing context on racial disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Inequality as a Driver of Crime: Gesin’s study reinforces the concept that economic disparities play a significant role in crime rates. This finding supports my project’s focus on examining how poverty and economic disadvantage in Black communities contribute to higher crime and policing rates3.\nSocial and Family Structure as Crime Factors: The correlation between family structure and crime emphasizes that socioeconomic and social stability are crucial in understanding crime rates. This insight is particularly relevant for exploring how social stability (or instability) within Chicago’s marginalized communities impacts crime and policing3.\nRacial Dynamics in Crime Rates: The study’s findings on racial disparities in crime rates provide a foundation for analyzing how systemic factors, like poverty and segregation, uniquely affect Black communities. This aligns with my project’s aim of contextualizing over-policing in racialized and economically disadvantaged neighborhoods3.\n\n\n\n\nGesin’s research provides valuable empirical support for understanding the socioeconomic factors driving crime in marginalized communities, aligning closely with the aims of this project:\n\nSupporting Socioeconomic Analysis: The data on income inequality and unemployment directly support my project’s focus on the economic roots of crime. Gesin’s findings underscore how financial hardship exacerbates crime, emphasizing the importance of addressing economic disparities in crime prevention strategies.\nSocial and Family Stability as Predictors: The relationship between family structure and violent crime rates aligns with my project’s focus on structural factors contributing to crime. This insight suggests that fostering social stability in marginalized communities could help reduce crime rates, supporting broader efforts to mitigate over-policing.\nRacial Dynamics and Community Segregation: Gesin’s examination of racial disparities in crime rates provides a foundation for analyzing how Black communities in Chicago are disproportionately impacted by economic disadvantage and systemic law enforcement bias. This reinforces the significance of racial dynamics in studying over-policing and its effects on community well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article by Heather Cherone (2023) documents Chicago’s troubling status as the leading city for wrongful convictions in the U.S., accounting for more than half of all exonerations nationwide in 2022. This analysis, based on data from the National Registry of Exonerations, reveals systemic patterns of police misconduct and racial disparities in wrongful convictions, aligning closely with my project’s exploration of over-policing and its broader impact on marginalized communities4.\n\n\n\nExoneration Statistics: In 2022, Cook County recorded 124 overturned convictions, representing over half of all U.S. exonerations. This statistic underscores the prevalence of wrongful convictions within Chicago’s justice system, setting a comparative context for examining Chicago’s unique struggle with systemic misconduct4.\nRacial Disparities: The National Registry of Exonerations reports that nearly all individuals exonerated in Cook County in 2022 were Black or Latino, highlighting racial biases within Chicago’s criminal justice system. This detail strengthens my project’s focus on racialized over-policing and criminalization of marginalized communities4.\nPattern of Police Misconduct: The article identifies significant police misconduct by former officers Ronald Watts and Reynaldo Guevara, linked to the majority of 2022 exonerations. Their actions included extortion, framing suspects, and other corrupt practices. This misconduct exemplifies how individual abuses can perpetuate systemic injustice, impacting community trust4.\nFinancial Costs of Misconduct: Wrongful convictions and police misconduct impose heavy financial burdens on Chicago taxpayers. In 2022 alone, Chicago spent $98 million to settle police misconduct lawsuits, with the 2023 budget allocating an additional $82 million. This economic impact provides a powerful argument for preventive reforms to reduce costs and improve community well-being4.\nHistorical Context and Ongoing Compliance Issues: Despite a federal consent decree from 2017, the Chicago Police Department remains only 3% compliant with required reforms, indicating institutional resistance to change. This minimal compliance rate highlights the significant barriers to reform, supporting my project’s exploration of systemic obstacles in addressing police misconduct4.\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemic Racial Disparities in Wrongful Convictions: The data shows that Black and Latino individuals face disproportionate impacts from wrongful convictions, aligning with the project’s focus on how racial biases in policing can criminalize marginalized communities.\nFinancial Costs as a Social and Economic Issue: The taxpayer burden underscores that police misconduct is not only a community concern but also an economic one. This financial data offers strong support for advocating preventive reforms to reduce long-term costs associated with wrongful convictions.\nChallenges in Achieving Reform: The low compliance rate with the federal consent decree underscores the institutional challenges in achieving genuine reform within the Chicago Police Department. This finding supports the project’s argument that overcoming systemic issues in policing requires community-driven reforms alongside judicial oversight.\n\n\n\n\nThe data from the National Registry of Exonerations provides both quantitative and qualitative evidence that is essential to my project:\n\nEmpirical Support for Racial Disparities: The high percentage of Black and Latino individuals wrongfully convicted supports the project’s thesis that systemic bias within the Chicago police force disproportionately affects these communities.\nEconomic and Policy Implications: The financial data on settlements underscores that wrongful convictions impact the entire city’s budget, supporting the argument for long-term investments in systemic reforms.\nStructural Challenges to Reform: The minimal compliance with the federal consent decree suggests that achieving lasting change requires community accountability, highlighting the need for internal restructuring within the police department."

    "text": "The study by Boehme, Cann, and Isom (2022) provides an in-depth examination of how race, ethnicity, and community characteristics influence public perceptions of policing, with a focus on both over- and under-policing. This research is highly relevant to my project on the intersection of race, poverty, and policing in Chicago, offering insights into how community-level factors contribute to divergent policing experiences1.\n\n\n\nThe Over-Under-Policing Paradox in Marginalized Communities: Boehme et al. highlight the duality of policing in marginalized communities, where residents often feel simultaneously over-policed through aggressive surveillance and under-policed in terms of protection and support. This paradox aligns with my project’s goal of investigating systemic biases in policing, revealing how this dual dynamic fosters a feedback loop of distrust and isolation from law enforcement1.\nRace as a Predictor of Perceptions: The study demonstrates that race consistently predicts perceptions of policing, with Black and Latinx communities reporting higher levels of over-policing regardless of economic conditions or other neighborhood factors. This finding supports the view that systemic racial biases in policing are pervasive, directly impacting Black and Latinx residents’ lived experiences. This insight strengthens my project’s focus on understanding the racialized nature of policing in Chicago1.\nPolicy Recommendations for Community-Based Reforms: Boehme and colleagues advocate for culturally sensitive reforms to improve police-community relations. Suggested reforms include adopting community-oriented policing models, reallocating resources to social services, and using non-police responders for non-violent incidents. These recommendations align with my project’s exploration of solutions to address both over- and under-policing by reimagining the role of police within marginalized communities1.\n\n\n\n\nBoehme et al. utilize data from the PHDCN (Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods) Community Survey, which provides a robust dataset that informs my own project’s focus on Chicago’s community dynamics.\n\nSurvey Scope and Sampling: The PHDCN survey includes 8,782 respondents across 343 neighborhood clusters in Chicago, derived from the city’s 847 census tracts. This sampling method offers a granular view of neighborhood-level factors, which is essential for understanding perceptions of policing across different community types in Chicago1.\nSurvey Timing and Context: Data collection for the PHDCN survey took place shortly after the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, capturing early responses to increased policing efforts. This context is crucial for understanding how federal policies may have intensified policing in Black communities, informing my analysis of systemic policing disparities in Chicago1.\n\n\n\n\nBoehme et al. use Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) to explore how individual and community characteristics shape perceptions of policing. Key analytical methods include:\n\nUnconditional Models: These models revealed that a significant portion of the variance in perceptions of over- and under-policing could be attributed to neighborhood-level factors, underscoring the importance of community context1.\nMeans-as-Outcomes Models: These models analyzed how neighborhood characteristics—such as economic disadvantage and ethnic diversity—influence residents’ perceptions of policing1.\nRandom Coefficient Models: Findings showed that race and ethnicity significantly impacted perceptions of policing, even after controlling for neighborhood factors. This reinforces the racialized experiences of policing, supporting my project’s objective to highlight the socio-economic roots of policing disparities in Chicago1.\n\n\n\n\nBoehme et al. provide valuable insights for understanding the dual impacts of over- and under-policing on marginalized communities. Here’s how these findings integrate with my project:\n\nReinforcing Racial Disparities in Policing: The study consistently shows that Black and Latinx residents report both over-policing and under-policing more frequently than their White counterparts. This underscores the racialized nature of policing and supports my project’s focus on the disproportionate impact of over-policing on Black communities in Chicago1.\nNeighborhood Characteristics as Predictors: Factors such as concentrated disadvantage and ethnic diversity emerged as significant predictors of policing perceptions. These findings are aligned with my project’s goal to explore the socio-economic roots of policing disparities, suggesting that addressing these factors may mitigate negative perceptions of policing in marginalized communities1.\nFeedback Loop Insight: The study highlights a feedback loop where high legal cynicism and under-policing exacerbate community distrust, fueling a cycle of under-service and over-surveillance. This dynamic is critical to my project’s focus on understanding how systemic issues perpetuate harmful feedback loops in marginalized communities1."

    "text": "The paper by Jones-Brown and Williams (2021) provides a comprehensive analysis of systemic over-policing in Black communities across the U.S., with findings that are particularly relevant for exploring the dynamics in Chicago2. This review highlights the key findings and data sources from the study, aligning with my focus on race, poverty, and policing.\n\n\n\nEmpirical Evidence of Racial Disparities: The authors reference a range of empirical studies that provide quantitative evidence on racial disparities in police interactions, such as traffic stops and arrests. Data shows that Black individuals experience higher rates of police encounters, including consent searches and minor stops, reinforcing stereotypes that link Black identity to criminality2.\nHigh-Profile Cases and Lived Experience: Citing cases such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the study captures the traumatic impact of over-policing on Black communities. These high-profile incidents serve as symbolic representations of a broader, systemic issue, fostering a legacy of fear and distrust toward law enforcement2.\nCommunity Distrust and Psychological Impact: Qualitative accounts from Black community members, including former Black police officers, reveal that recurrent negative police encounters create an environment of fear and mistrust. Black residents in areas such as Ferguson report feeling subjected to racialized social control, highlighting the psychosocial toll of over-policing in marginalized communities2.\nInfluence of Media Narratives: The study discusses how social media platforms have become a powerful tool for documenting police brutality and over-policing. Instances that gain traction online often reveal patterns of aggressive policing toward Black individuals, which the authors argue are reinforced by biased mainstream media portrayals that mischaracterize Black-led protests as violent, unlike predominantly White protests2.\nHistorical Context and Policy Analysis: The authors incorporate historical data, such as findings from the 1967 Katzenbach Report and the impact of the “War on Drugs,” to contextualize the persistence of racialized policing.

Use academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) to find relevant studies and ensure a broad scope.\nSkim the Abstracts\nRead the abstracts of each paper to quickly understand their focus and identify those most relevant to your topic. Prioritize these papers for deeper analysis.\nUse LLM Tools for Summarization\nUpload the selected papers to an LLM tool capable of text summarization. Have it condense the main points of each paper into a concise, manageable summary (e.g., condense hundreds of pages into a 10-page summary). Carefully review this summary to absorb the key insights.\nLeverage Interactive LLM Tools\nUse tools like NotebookLM or other AI-based text digesters to ask specific, targeted questions about the papers:\n\nExample questions:\n\n“In the papers uploaded, did any of them explore XYZ?”\n“Which paper is most closely related to the following project idea: [explain idea]?” These tools will help you quickly extract relevant information without re-reading entire papers."

They prioritize high-level insights, actionable results, and visualizations that convey the impact of data without requiring an understanding of complex methods. For instance, a CEO may want to know how a model affects business strategy or revenue, without diving into the underlying technical details.\n\nIn this project you will cater to both audiences.

To achieve an A-level grade, you are expected to exceed the specifications and create unique, novel solutions.\nFor example: If you’re asked to build visualizations to support your data science story, you won’t be told how many or what type of visualizations to create. This is up to you, based on your data and the creativity and quality you want to demonstrate.\nWe want you to move away from expecting someone else to tell you what to do, how to do it, and how much to do. Instead, you’ll adopt a professional approach—reviewing specifications provided in the assignments, determining what’s needed to exceed expectations, and demonstrating professional excellence.\nThere are countless ways to approach the project requirements, so be creative and thoughtful. Instructions outline the minimum requirements, but exceeding them will elevate the quality of your work.\nAutonomy and Critical Thinking:\n\nIn the workplace, step-by-step instructions are rare. You’ll need to interpret broad requirements and deliver professional results. Producing high-quality, accurate work with limited guidance is a key professional skill.\nAt this stage, move away from asking, “Do I have to do XYZ?” Instead, critically analyze challenges. If something is unclear, investigate and break it down fundamentally.\n\nDeveloping problem-solving skills is crucial.

You don’t necessarily need to have a project that acheive the following, but here are some guidelines for what makes “high impact” projects:\nIn no particular order:\n\nNovel computational tools: For example, development of a new Python package to tackle a class of problem which doesn’t have an existing suitable tool.\nCreating more user-friendly tools: For example, there might be a great C++ code, but with no python analogue. Python is easier to use, so if you make a pythonic version of an existing tool, it may get higher adoption, provided it is more or less as efficient to the competitors.\nMore efficient tools or methods: Achieving something 1.25x, 2x, 10x or 10000x faster than existing methods, or creating a new code package that is more efficient than a previous one.\nNovel methods: A completely new way of doing something (e.g. new classification algorithm)\nExisting methods applied to new domains: Using established methods to solve problems in a novel domain, e.g. applying a particular classification methodology to a problem or dataset that no one has applied it to before. Extent of impact obviously depends on the importance of the domain or use-case.\nCreation of novel Data Sets: Provides well-curated, clean datasets that can be used to address important scientific questions or problems.(often more useful if there is an accompanying API)\nNew insights or phenomena: Using data analysis techniques to uncover new insights or patterns that address key questions or problems. For example, discovering overarching governing rules (e.g., differential equations) that describe some observed phenomena.\n\nSolves a Major Problem: Addresses a critical or unresolved issue in the field, offering a breakthrough or significant advancement.\n\nRobust Data and Methodology: Employs sound, validated methodologies and high-quality data to ensure credibility and reliability (i.e. doing something rigorously, correctly, and generally better than the competition).\nInterdisciplinary Impact: Influences multiple fields or areas of study, increasing the breadth of its significance.\nHigh Citation Potential: Likely to be widely cited due to its significance, relevance, and applicability across different areas.\n\nYou can, of course, have multiple of these components in a single project, which will increase its prestige.\nThis is especially true when conducting academic research. Publications need to be novel and make a unique contribution to the body of human knowledge; otherwise, they will not be highly cited or considered particularly important."

Starting with a blank page is a valuable practice.\nTo get comfortable with the methods, review and modify the R and Python codes provided in class. Try applying these to your project data and experiment with creating small toy datasets, such as a CSV file or a text corpus. This helps you understand the structure of the data and what the algorithms are doing.\n\n\nPrototype and develop on a small data set\nIf you have big data, ALWAYS prototype on a small subset of the data, so that your code runs fast so that you can develop quickly, without waiting several minutes for each code cell to run. Do this by including a downsampling hyper-parameter at the beginning of your code, e.g. 0.1. When the code is robust and finalized, you can set the downsampling factor to 1, run it on the complete data set, and let your computer run overnight.\nIt is not a crazy idea to do a “trial run” of the project first from start to finish with a very basic dataset, e.g. penguins,diabetes, or iris. Make sure the “toy” data set is similar to your planned real world data set, for example, if you are planning an NLP project, don’t use a image dataset for your development process.\nThis will have the following benefits:\n\nClarifies Workflow: Understand the complete process from start to finish.\nIdentifies Challenges: Spot potential issues early on.\nValidates Assumptions: Ensure methods and approaches are suitable.\nEnhances Skills: Improve technical skills through practice.\nBuilds Confidence: Familiarity with tools and techniques.\nRefines Methods: Test and optimize analytical strategies.\nEstimates Resources: Better planning for time and resource allocation.\nFacilitates Communication: Clearly convey project goals and outcomes.\nDocuments Process: Create a reference for reproducibility.\nGathers Early Feedback: Obtain input for adjustments before full implementation.\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html\nOnce that is working as a starter code-base you can swap it out for your full data later and start developing further for a more realistic real world project ."

    "text": "Quarto Includes\nQuarto includes (e.g., {{&lt; include _content.qmd &gt;}}) are highly recommended for modularizing and organizing your content. While optional, they offer several advantages.\nNote: You can include a .qmd file in a .ipynb file, but not vice versa.\n\nWhy Use Quarto Includes?\n\nModularization: Breaking your project into smaller, reusable chunks simplifies the management of complex documents. You can work on specific sections without altering the entire project.\nReusability: Includes allow you to reuse content blocks across multiple documents, making them ideal for repetitive sections like headers or footers.\nConsistency: By using includes, you ensure uniformity across your documents. Updating an include file will automatically apply the changes wherever it’s used.\nSimplifies Collaboration: In team settings, includes allow different contributors to work on separate sections simultaneously, reducing merge conflicts and making the project easier to maintain.\nImproved Organization: Includes help keep your main files clean and focused by loading content from separate, well-organized files. This makes your project more manageable and easier to navigate."

    "text": "The following is a list of some of the things you should address on this page. This list is not exhaustive, and you should use your judgment to decide what is most relevant to your project.\nPlease do some form of “Feature selection” in your project and include a section on it. Discuss the process you went through to select the features that you used in your model, this should be done for both classification models and regression models. What did you include and why? What did you exclude? What was the reasoning behind your decisions? This section can be included here, or you can make a new page in the dropdown menu for it.\nPlease break this page into a “regression” section, “binary classification” section, and a “Multi-class classification” section. For each case you should try multiple methods, including those discussed in class, and compare and contrast their preformance and results."
